# Fundamentals of Data Visualization

[Book](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/index.html) by: [Claus O. Wilke](https://wilkelab.org/)

** **

The source codes, which are published on GitHub ([dataviz](https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz)), in this book were writen in R. In this project, I will try to apply what I have learned from the book and replicate them in **Python**.
